# Course Planner

## CPSC 210 Term Project



This is a course planner to be used mostly by students who need a place to organize all their **projects, midterms, 
and exams**. The application will organize and show you of upcoming deadlines and exams.  

As a student myself, I find having to keep track of important dates across 5 to 6 courses 
overwhelming, and I want an application that will help me stay organized and on track throughout
the term. 

*Some Features:*
- Input courses and organize exams and projects within each course
- Shows upcoming assignments 
- Check off assignments when they are completed
